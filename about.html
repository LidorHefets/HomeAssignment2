              I was born in August 1998 and grew up in Moshav Azriel, located in the Lev HaSharon Regional Council.  
              I have two younger sisters and loving parents who supported me throughout my journey.  
              From a young age, I was passionate about sportsâ€”especially soccer and basketballâ€”both playing and watching.  
              During high school, I developed a strong interest in technology and economics, and thatâ€™s when I knew I had found my path and decided to pursue it seriously.

              I'm currently a second-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a specialization in Information Systems at the Ruppin Academic Center.  
              I'm deeply interested in the business world and have always wanted to explore the field of information systems.  
              Alongside my studies, I volunteer in the college's newly established Search and Rescue Unit.  
              In the photo on the left, you can see me during one of the unitâ€™s training exercises.

              After completing my military service, I applied for a delegation program through The Jewish Agency.  
              I was selected to serve as a summer camp emissary for the Ramah youth movement in the summer of 2022.  
              The camp took place in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where I worked as a soccer counselor.  
              It was a meaningful and enriching experience that strengthened my connection with Diaspora Jewry and significantly improved my English communication skills.

              One of my favorite hobbies is traveling. I love exploring both Israel and the world, and this year Iâ€™ll be reaching my 10th country!  
              So far, Iâ€™ve traveled across Europe, the United States, and several countries in South America.  
              In the photo on the left, you can see me at a viewpoint overlooking Laguna ParÃ³n in Peru.
